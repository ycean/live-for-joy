# time-efficient-improve-for-walking-robot
THE FILE CONSIST:
1) MIQP is consiting all the simulation data for conventional walking simulation
	a)sim_with_qp -> is the folder that consists of the simulation result including the simulation raw data

2) SL is the folder consisting the simulation data for the walking robot that using supervise trained joint model
	a)trained_joint_model_and_simulation_result -> all the trained joint model and simulation result are included

*notes: for comparing between the conventional result and the supervise learning result, the file for epcoch number 5000 is refer.
